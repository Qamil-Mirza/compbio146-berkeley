Therefore, there is no skeleton code and minimal guidance for these questions. Students are welcome to go beyond the scope of the question or adapt the question as necessary to answer their own scientific questions of interest. You are welcome to create as many coding cells as you would like for these mini-projects. In order to get extra credit, students should make a reasonable attempt (as judged by the grader) on at least one question and write a brief report.\n",
